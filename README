  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The open issures are as follows:

    *   There is no requirement tracebility to a particular line in a file
        containing the expected results

    *   There is no provisions for Software Development Document (SDD)
        design requirements and tracing functional requirements to design
        requirements and to design requirements tests

    *   Functional requirements are basically requirements important to the
        end-user and stated for the point of view of the end-user. Test
        coverage is not an issue. However, when design requirements are
        added to the mix, test coverage of the design requirements becomes
        important.
