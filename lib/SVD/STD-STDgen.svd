PROBLEMS:
The open issures are as follows:

=over 4

=item *

There is no requirement tracebility to a particular line
in a file containing the expected results

=item *

There is no provisions for Software Development Document (SDD)
design requirements and tracing functional requirements to
design requirements and to design requirements tests

=item *

Functional requirements are basically requirements important
to the end-user and stated for the point of view of the
end-user.  
Test coverage is not an issue. 
However, when design requirements are added to the mix,
test coverage of the design requirements becomes important.
