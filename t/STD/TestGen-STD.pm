There are no safety precautions or privacy considerations
for these tests.

=head2 Hardware preparation

Prepare the site hardware by following general
operating procedure to apply power the computer
running Perl under the site operating system.

=head2 Software preparation

There are no preparations. The tests will
determine if the STD::TestGen program module is installed.
If any test fails, contact

 http://www.SoftwareDiamonds.com support@SoftwareDiamonds.com

for consultation on corrective actions.

=head2 Other pre-test preparations

None.

=head2 Criteria for evaluating results.

The criteria for tests and test cases
is an exact match of the acutual test results
and the expected test results.
The Perl L<Test|Test> module determines whether
the actual test results are exactly the same as the expected
test results. 

=head2 Test procedure.

All test and test cases are performed by running the following test script:

 TestGen.t

There are no assumptions or constraints.

=head1 TEST DESCRIPTIONS

These test descriptions verify the requirments 
as specifed in the L<STD::TestGen|STD::TestGen>, 
Plain Old Documentation (POD).
These test descriptions contain 14 tests.

A unique test identification used herein consists of the
the test number that is produce by executing the Perl 
test script file:

 TestGen.t

The unique test number id within this module
and the the unique Perl identification for
this module, L<STD\testgen.std|STD\testgen.std>, 
provide an unique Perl system wide identifier of the test.

There are no safety procautions or security
and privacy considerations for any of the tests
or test cases.

  =head2 1.3 Document overview

  This document establishes the tests to verify the requirements
  specified in the Perl Plain Old Documentation (POD)
  of the L<STD::tg1|STD::tg1>.
  The L<SEE ALSO|SEE ALSO> references literature on PODs.

  The format of this document is in accordance with

  =head1 TEST PREPARATIONS

  There are no safety precautions or privacy considerations
  for these tests.

  =head2 Hardware preparation

  Prepare the site hardware by following general
  operating procedure to apply power the computer
  running Perl under the site operating system.

  =head2 Software preparation

  There are no preparations. The tests will
  determine if the STD::tg1 program module is installed.
  If any test fails, contact

   http://www.SoftwareDiamonds.com support@SoftwareDiamonds.com

  for consultation on corrective actions.

  =head2 Other pre-test preparations

  None.

  =head2 Criteria for evaluating results.

  The criteria for tests and test cases
  is an exact match of the acutual test results
  and the expected test results.
  The Perl L<Test|Test> module determines whether
  the actual test results are exactly the same as the expected
  test results. 

  =head2 Test procedure.

  All test and test cases are performed by running the following test script:

   tgA1.t

  =head2 Assumptions and constraints.

  There are no assumptions or constraints.

  =head1 TEST DESCRIPTIONS

  These test descriptions verify the requirments 
  as specifed in the L<STD::tg1|STD::tg1>, 
  Plain Old Documentation (POD).
  These test descriptions contain 16 tests.

  A unique test identification used herein consists of the
  the test number that is produce by executing the Perl 
  test script file:

   tgA1.t

  The unique test number id within this module
  and the the unique Perl identification for
  this module, L<STD/tgA1.std|STD/tgA1.std>, 
  provide an unique Perl system wide identifier of the test.

  There are no safety procautions or security
  and privacy considerations for any of the tests
  or test cases.
